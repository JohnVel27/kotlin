# KOTLIN

Kotlin is a programming language made by JetBrains, the same company that created IntelliJ IDEA. Here are the key points about Kotlin in simple terms:

1. Easy to Use: Kotlin has a simpler and more straightforward syntax than Java, which means you can write less code to do the same thing.

2. Safe: It helps prevent common errors, like null pointer exceptions, making your code more reliable.

3. Works with Java: You can use Kotlin and Java together in the same project. This makes it easier to switch to Kotlin if you already have a lot of Java code.

4. Modern Features: Kotlin includes many modern programming features, like functions that can be passed around as variables (called lambdas), and coroutines for easier handling of tasks that run in the background.

5. Popular for Android: Google supports Kotlin for Android app development, and it has become very popular for building Android apps.

6. Versatile: You can use Kotlin for server-side applications, web development (it can compile to JavaScript), and even share code between different platforms (like Android and iOS).
